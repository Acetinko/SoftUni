The above code defines a class that contains information about a subscription card.
An instance of the class should support the following operations:
	Can be instantiated with three parameters
	– first and last name and a Social Security number (SSN)
	Accessor firstName
	– used to get the value of firstName.
	Accessor lastName 
	– used to get the value of lastName.
	Accessor SSN
	– used to get the value of SSN.
	Accessor isBlocked
	– used to find out if the card is blocked.
	Function addSubscription()
	– adds an entry in the subscriptions with start and end date.
	Function isValid()
	– return true if the card is valid for the given date; read further for validity checks
	Function block()
	– set block to true.
	Function unblock()
	– set block to false.
Once created, the values of firstName, lastName and SSN must not be changed, 
so these properties do not have defined setters and should not be directly accessible. 
The values are not validated.
A subscription will have the following format:
{
  line: String,
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date
}
The value of line can be set to "*" (asterisk), 
which means it covers all lines. 
The function isValid() must iterate through all available subscriptions and
see if there is one for the given line, or one for all lines, 
with starting date before or on the given date and end date after or on the given date. 
If the card is blocked, the function must always return false.

-Instantinated the class with 3 paremeters
	// object creation
	- create instance with correct parameters;
	- firstName accessor should return the firstName;
	- lastName accessor should return the lastName;
	- SSN accessor should return SSN
	- card._substriptoin should return []
	- isBocked should return trurn false on new card
	// check the accessors
	- firstName cant be changed directly
	- lastName cant be changed directly
	- SSN cant be changed directly
- otherFunctions
	- block should change isBlocked return to true;
	- addSubscription(line, startDate, endDate) should add subscriptions
- isValid(line, date)
	- return false if card is blocked;
	- return false if _substriptions does not contain line
	- return false if _substriptions contains line but are out of date
	- return false if _substriptions contains some line = * but are out of date
	- return true if _substriptions contains line
